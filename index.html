            <h3>Hello.</h3><br>
            <p>Hello! My name is Adam Manji. I am a high school student with a deep passion for Computer Science, from Web Dev to AI and everything in between.</p>
            <p>I created this website to host any projects I work on. I'm hoping to build up a portfolio over the coming years.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>About Me.</h3><br>
            <p>I started coding in the fall of 2018 and have been doing it ever since.</p>
            <p>I have quite a bit of experience in Java, as well as Web Development using both Python and Javascript. Recently, I've started learning more about AI and creating Neural Networks. I am also interested in game and app development.</p>
            <p>Hopefully, I will be able to keep learning more and more about Computer Science, as I am still <i>relatively</i> new to it. I look forward to exploring Web Dev and social networks more, but would love to learn to develop mobile apps.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Running List of Projects</h3><br>
            <p>See the projects tab (coming soon) for more details</p>
            <ul>
            <li><a href="https://adam-finance.herokuapp.com/login">Simulated Investing</a> - An app which allows users to quote stock prices, buy and sell stocks and manage their portfolio. It was built during the summer of 2019 at the Harvard Pre-College Program using CS50 libraries. The app uses Flask framework and sqlite3 databasing.</li>
            <li><a href='https://imaginetechcompany.github.io/ImagineSpace/'>ImagineSpace</a> - A social networking platform for users to connect, share, discover and level up. The platform was built during the 2018-2019 school year as a project and was my introduction to Web Development. It uses a Firebase backend.</li>
            <li>More projects, past and present, will be listed soon.</li>
